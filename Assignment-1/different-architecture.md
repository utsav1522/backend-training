<h1>Different Types of Architectures</h1>

## Monolithic Service Architecture:
<p align="justify">
A monolithic service architecture is one in which the entire application has only one large codebase to perform all the business logics and all the code for the application is linked. Small changes to the codebase may lead to the large changes in the application.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
It is difficult and time consuming to understand the codebase for an appplication written in a monolithic architecture. Even if a small component is not working in the application. the entire application might turn down. 
</p>

<p align = "justify">
Not must pre-development planning in required for a monolithic arhitecture as it is a single codebase, one can easily start with the development process and continue development, although, the application might become complex overtime. Also upon deplotying the application to server, it is required to have enough data and bandwidth to push the code.
</p>


## Micro-Service Architecture:
<p align = "justify">
A Microservices architecture is an architecture in which the application is broken down to small services and each service runs independently. As each codebase is independent, any change to a particluar service does not affect the application but the service itself only. 
</p>
<p align = "justify">
The Microservices architecture is comparitively easy to understand and is less time consuming. Whenever a service is down, the features/UI presented by the service is accessible to the user and the entire application does not turns down.

## Serverless Architecture:

<p align = "justify">
Serverless architecture is a modern approach to handle the traffic and allow the horizontal as well as the verticle scaling of the servers in order to meet the traffic demands of the application / servers.
</p>

<p align = "justify">
In Serverless architecture, although server is not present at the production site, but it is present at a remote location which can be accessed and contents of the website can be updated. The servers are allotted to the website/application as per the traffic on the same. 
</p>

<p align = "justify">
In case of serverless architecture, the developers and IT team need not worry about the traffic before hand and make the necessary arrangements of servers. This is because it might be possible that the demand might not rise as per the prediction on the servers or might also happen that the demand might unexpectedy. It is also possible that the demand might rise at a particular time of the day and might need the extra servers for that part of the day only and not on other parts. Thus to prevent such cases and wastage of resources, a new concept of Serverless architecture is introduced in which these predictions need not be made and the servers can be made available as per the demand and it is also economically beneficial as it helps to reduce the cost of the servers. This also helps the developers to focus more on the development process rather than focusing on the servers.

Serverless architecture provides a benefit of scalability and
